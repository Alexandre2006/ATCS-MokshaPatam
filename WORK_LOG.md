| Aug 29 | In-Class (Last 20 Minutes) | Initially tried using a DFS (Depth First Search) solution, but found it too complex. Had many bugs relating to how the board was formatted, how I set up my helper function, etc. Chose to switch to BFS for this problem. |
| Aug 29 | 20:30 - 20:55              | Implemented a BFS (Breadth first search) solution. Spent 15 minutes writing the first code, and 10 minutes debugging an issue where only one of the tests was failing. I forgot the board was 1-indexed and not 0-indexed. |
